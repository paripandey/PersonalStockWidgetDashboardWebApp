			<h2>What are stocks?</h2>

			Imagine owning a tiny piece of your favorite company. That's what a stock is – a share, a slice, a piece of the action.

			<br><br>

			Now, why are stocks so powerful? Well, when a company does well, its value goes up, and so does the value of your slice! It's like being a co-owner in the success of businesses you believe in. But it's not just about owning a piece; it's about the potential to make your money work for you, growing over time.

			<br><br>

			Why do people and companies trade these slices? It's like a giant marketplace. Companies sell stocks to raise money for cool projects and expansions. And you? You can buy and sell these slices, trading them like a game of cards. It's how people aim to grow their wealth and companies get the cash they need to thrive.

			<br><br>

			In a nutshell, stocks are a ticket to the business world – your chance to join the ride of growth and success. So, buckle up, new learner! Welcome to a world where your money has the potential to grow with the companies you believe in. Let the stock market adventure begin!
